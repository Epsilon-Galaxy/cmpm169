				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to test out and use the tracery library for myself. I ended up creating a pretty meh haiku generator, but it's pretty fun to see what it makes. I want to try to make it more legible and sound more human like and I'll probably have to tone down or add more strict rules.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It works by using the tracery library and using the idea of replacement sort of like playing those madlib word games.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I felt like I can do more with this. I want to be able to read what is written and perhaps generate some 3d effect when certain words are picked. Maybe make a haiku generator that is revolved around weather and depending on the conditions that are laid out in the haiku different weather effects will be played out.</p>
